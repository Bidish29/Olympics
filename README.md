# Olympics
The aim of this project is to clean,process and visualize the Olympic Dataset

I am exploring the Olympics dataset from Kaggle. I am trying to answer the following questions, 
1. What are the top 10 sports played during the Summer Olympics and how have they evolved over a 50-year period? 
2. How have the countries fared in terms of medals and which country has had the most success and which countries have had the least
success in terms of medals won and how have they been distributed?

To visualize the question 1, I have used an interactive scatter plot to show which sports have been the most popular over time 
and to visualize question 2, I have used a choropleth map of the world to show how the medals have been distributed over a 
120-year period among the countries of the world. I have used Python and Jupyter Notebook for the purpose of data cleaning 
and visualizations.
